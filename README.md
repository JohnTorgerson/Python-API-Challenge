# Unit 6 Homework: Planning Vacation based on Weather Conditions

### Summary

>Randomly generate specific weather condition data using an API pull and JSON
Clean the data, and generate a heatmap based on latitude and longitude coordinates
Reduce the data set to three reasonable conditions that are preferred by the user
With the remaining coordinates generate a list of nearest hotels using another API pull along with google search criteria

### Contents:
* 'https://openweathermap.org/' is the app used to randomly generate world city climate data and locations
* 'https://cloud.google.com/' is the app used to create heatmaps and gather hotel data
* `hotel_df.csv` : the reduced dataset matched to user's ideal conditions, saved as a csv
* `city_data.csv` : the original cleaned dataset generated from randomly pulling from openweather, saved as a csv
* `WeatherPY.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook used to randomly gather and clean climate data for world cities
* `VacationPY.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook used to narrow the data to ideal conditions and generate hotels
* 'x.png' : ANY png files are either maps or plot graphs related to the results of this data
